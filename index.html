            <h1><strong>Quick Overview</strong></h1>
            <p>The first thing that anybody should know about me is that I am quiet and reserved. In front of strangers, at least. I've been like that since I was a child. I am never comfortable initiating small talk or conversation in general. Which probably explains why I don't have a lot of acquaintances, and why people think I'm a snob. Don't get me wrong, though. I can be very talkative if we get along just fine.</p>

            <h1><strong>Vital Statistics</strong></h1>
            <p>I'm 6'2" in my dreams. 5'5" in real life. My metabolism is fast when I work for it. I used to weigh a very modest 63 kg, which is perfect for my height. I also used to go to the gym but the pandemic added 3 more kilograms to my weight that I have yet to burn. All the added weight made me look shorter, unfortunately.</p>

            <h1><strong>My Dreams</strong></h1>
            <p>My dreams lost their consistency when I was 13. I really wanted to be a teacher like my parents in my early age. But I soon saw within myself that it is a profession to be tackled late in my career. I had to go get experience if I were to teach anything. As of now, my dream is to become a software developer.</p>

            <h1><strong>My Passion</strong></h1>
            <p>I'm passionate about getting better. If I really set my heart onto something, I'm going to give my all in order to achieve it. One such example is touch typing. During the second half of 2019 I only averaged 35 wpm, and just a year later, I bumped it up to 70wpm. This kind of commitment, however, happens rarely for whatever reason.</p>
