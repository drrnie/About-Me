                    <h1><strong>Height</strong></h1>  
                    <p>I am 6'2" in my dreams. In real life, that translates to only 5'5". Quite unfortunate, but not totally unlucky.</p>

                    <p>I weighed a very optimal 63 kgs before the pandemic. Since then I gained 3 more kilos that I have yet to burn. Yikes.</p>

                    <h1><strong>To be a [Cool] Teacher</strong></h1>  
                    <p>I've dreamed of being a teacher ever since I was a kid, probably because my parents are both teachers. But I soon realized that this profession would come late in my career. If I were to teach something, I have to be good at it and gain experience from it first.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Software Developer</strong></h1>
                    <p>As I grew older, I became attached to computers and how they work. Eventually, I found knack for soft dev. This doesn't mean that I'm exceptional at it, however. It still gives me headaches. But hey, I like coding stuff.</p>

                    <p>Now this one, this is a dream from 4 years ago that still remains a dream. I'm working on it but the road is just tough. Don't get me wrong, I'm making progress. It's just that often times, life sucks and we have to deal with it ourselves.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Gaming</strong></h1>  
                    <p>Gaming is the main factor that made me attached to computers. From Pinball, House of the Dead, to Dota, LoL and Valorant, it has stuck with me the moment I first held a mouse and keyboard. My gaming skills are subpar though. Yikes.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Music</strong></h1>
                    <p>I can't thank God enough for giving me the ability to sing and manipulate music. It's the one of those things that gets me through slumps and just a very handy talent to have in general.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Reading</strong></h1>
                    <p>Reading was my form of time travel. It's just this feeling you get when you read a good book, almost as if merging through this environment hidden within patterns of ink embedded in crisp pages. It's like dreaming awake, and I think that's beautiful.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Getting Better</strong></h1>
                    <p>I've always been passionate about puttin' in work, be it physical, emotional, or spritual. One such example is my touch typing career. Back in the second half of 2019, I can barely type 35 wpm. After 1 and a half year of practice, I bumped up my average to 75 wpm.</p>
